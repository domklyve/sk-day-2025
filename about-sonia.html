                <p>A pioneering mathematician who broke barriers and opened doors for generations to come</p>

                <h2>A Revolutionary Life (1850-1891)</h2>
                
                <p>When Sofya Korvin-Krukovskaya (later known as Sonia Kovalevsky) was born in Russia in 1850, women were not allowed to study at a university without the permission of either their father or their husband. When her father wouldn't grant permission for her to study mathematics, she arranged a platonic marriage with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a paleontology student and political radical. Sofya and Vladimir moved to Germany in 1869 for both of them to pursue advanced studies.</p>

                <h3>Overcoming Barriers in Germany</h3>
                <p>Once in Heidelberg, Germany, Sofya (nicknamed Sonja or Sonia) was only allowed to audit classes because she was a woman, and she had to request special permission from each professor to do so. Auditing means that she could attend class but not receive credit towards a degree. Sonja studied physics and mathematics.</p>

                <p>When Sonja later moved to Berlin, the university wouldn't even let women audit classes, so she took private math lessons with Karl Weierstrass. Four years later, her work with Weierstrass led to a doctorate in mathematics using partial differential equations to study the dynamics of Saturn's rings.</p>

                <h3>Professional Achievements</h3>
                <p>In 1883, her husband Vladimir committed suicide, and in 1884 Sonia moved to Sweden as an "Extraordinary Professor" at Stockholm University – the American equivalent is an assistant professor. By 1889, she was promoted to an "Ordinary Professor," which is equivalent to a Full Professor today.</p>

                <p>Sadly, she died unexpectedly from pneumonia in 1891. She was only 41 years old.</p>

                        <li><strong>First woman</strong> to earn the modern form of a doctorate in mathematics</li>
                        <li><strong>First woman</strong> to hold a full professorship at a modern university</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>More Than a Mathematician</h3>
                <p>Sonja was also a progressive feminist who wrote two plays and an autobiographical novel, showcasing her talents beyond mathematics and her commitment to women's rights and social progress.</p>

                <h2>What's in a Name?</h2>
                <p>There are several alternative ways to write her name:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li>The Russian feminine form of her last name is <strong>Kovalevskaya</strong></li>
                    <li>She used <strong>Sophie Kowalevski</strong> in her own writing</li>
                    <li>After moving to Sweden near the end of her life, she used <strong>Sonja</strong> instead of Sophie</li>
                    <li>We know her now as <strong>Sonia Kovalevsky</strong></li>

                <h2>Her Lasting Legacy</h2>
                
                <h3>Honored in Space and on Earth</h3>
                <p>Sonia Kovalevsky's contributions to mathematics have been recognized around the world:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li>The impact crater <strong>Kovalevskaya</strong> on the far side of the moon is named after her</li>
                    <li>The asteroid <strong>1859 Kovalevskaya</strong> from the outer regions of the asteroid belt bears her name</li>
                    <li>In 2021, Argentina launched a satellite, <strong>Sofya</strong>, named in her honor</li>
                    <li><strong>St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Stockholm</strong> all have streets named after Sofya/Sonja Kovalevsky</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Inspiring Future Generations</h3>
                <p>Her legacy is carried on through Sonia Kovalevsky Days offered at universities across the United States. These events encourage young people, particularly young women, to explore mathematics and pursue careers in STEM fields.</p>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">Just as Sonia Kovalevskaya once defied expectations to unlock new mathematical truths and open doors for others, we believe that every person can be a mathematical detective—curious, creative, and courageous in solving life's mysteries.</p>

                <h2>Lessons from Sonia's Life</h2>
                
                <p>Sonia Kovalevsky's story teaches us several important lessons:</p>

                <h3>1. Persistence in the Face of Obstacles</h3>
                <p>Despite being barred from formal university education, Sonia found creative ways to pursue her passion for mathematics. She didn't let societal barriers stop her from achieving her goals.</p>

                <h3>2. The Importance of Allies and Mentors</h3>
                <p>While many professors refused to teach women, Karl Weierstrass recognized Sonia's talent and took her on as a private student. Finding supportive mentors and allies was crucial to her success.</p>

                <h3>3. Breaking Ground for Others</h3>
                <p>By becoming the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics and hold a full professorship, Sonia opened doors for countless women who followed. Her achievements showed the world what women could accomplish in mathematics.</p>

                <h3>4. Mathematics as a Creative Endeavor</h3>
                <p>Sonia's work on partial differential equations and the dynamics of Saturn's rings demonstrated that mathematics is not just about computation—it's about creativity, imagination, and understanding the natural world.</p>

                <h3>5. A Life Well-Rounded</h3>
                <p>Sonia didn't limit herself to mathematics alone. She was a writer, a feminist, and an advocate for education. Her life reminds us that we can be passionate about many things and that diverse interests enrich our work.</p>
