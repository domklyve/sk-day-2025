  <h1>Who was Sonia Kovalevsky?</h1>
  <div class="grid cols-2">
    <div class="card">
      <p>Born in Russia in 1850, <strong>Sonia (Sofya) Kovalevsky</strong> pursued mathematics despite formal barriers that kept women from university study. She audited courses at Heidelberg, studied privately with <em>Karl Weierstrass</em> in Berlin, and earned a pioneering doctorate for work on partial differential equations related to Saturn’s rings.</p>
      <p>After moving to Sweden, she became a professor at Stockholm University (first extraordinary, then ordinary professor) and authored plays and an autobiographical novel. Her legacy lives on in named features like the lunar crater <em>Kovalevskaya</em> and asteroid <em>1859 Kovalevskaya</em>, and in Sonia Kovalevsky Days across the U.S.</p>
      <p><em>She showed that great mathematics and great humanity belong together.</em></p>
