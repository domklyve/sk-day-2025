      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Dr. Jenny Quinn</h2>
      <p>Dr. Jenny Quinn’s personal mission is to make mathematics
accessible, appreciated, and humane. Actively engaging people
with math in both classrooms and communities, she believes
mathematics should be a lever that lifts people toward
their goals, not a barrier that keeps them from reaching their
dreams.</p>
      <p>An award-winning teacher, author, and scholar, Jenny earned
her Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–
Madison and has taught math for more than thirty years
at the college level—primarily at Occidental College and
the University of Washington Tacoma. She also served as
President of the Mathematical Association of America in
2021–2022. </p>
      <p>
        Now, as Executive Director of the Seattle Universal Math Museum (SUMM), Jenny leads an organization
whose mission is to spark each and every person to love math. In 2026, SUMM will
open an exhibit space within a beloved Seattle science institution and launch a public math lecture
series, Math Out Loud. Until then, the museum continues to bring hands-on, joyful math experiences
to the community—hosting nearly 400 events last year and reaching more than 19,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as Sonia Kovalevskaya once defied expectations to unlock new mathematical truths and open
doors for others, Jenny believes that every person can be a mathematical detective—curious, creative,
and courageous in solving life’s mysteries. Solving Mathematical Mysteries invites each of us
to follow in Sonia’s footsteps: to look deeper, think boldly, and discover the beauty and humanity
hidden within math.
