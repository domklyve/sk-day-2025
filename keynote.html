                <p>Dr. Quinn's commitment to making mathematics accessible and joyful aligns perfectly with the spirit of Sonia Kovalevsky Day. Like Sonia, who overcame tremendous barriers to pursue her passion for mathematics, Jenny works tirelessly to remove the barriers that keep people from discovering their own mathematical potential.</p>

                <h3>Key Themes in Dr. Quinn's Work</h3>
                
                <h4>Mathematics is for Everyone</h4>
                <p>No one should be excluded from mathematics because of their background, gender, or prior experiences. Everyone has the capacity to think mathematically and solve problems creatively.</p>

                <h4>Math Should Be Joyful</h4>
                <p>Mathematics isn't just about getting the right answer—it's about exploration, discovery, and the joy of understanding. When we approach math with curiosity and playfulness, it becomes accessible and engaging.</p>

                <h4>Hands-On Engagement</h4>
                <p>The best way to learn mathematics is by doing it. Through hands-on activities and real-world applications, people can develop a deep, intuitive understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>

                <h4>Building Community</h4>
                <p>Mathematics thrives when people work together, share ideas, and support each other's learning. Creating inclusive, welcoming spaces for mathematical exploration is essential.</p>
