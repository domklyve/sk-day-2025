## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo (e.g., `sonia-k-day`).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo (or push via git).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Source** = `Deploy from a branch`, branch = `main`, folder = `/root`.
4. Save. Your site will publish at `https://<username>.github.io/sonia-k-day/`.

> Date note: The event banner reads **Saturday, October 18** (no year). Edit directly in `index.html` if you want a year.
