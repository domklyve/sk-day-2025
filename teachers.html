                    <h3>Voting when Politically Divided</h3>
                    <p>If you want to bring relevancy to your math class, how about teaching about gerrymandering, or democratic voting systems, or fair representation? That's right; civics in the math class. Now let's be fair!</p>
                    <p>This session explores how mathematical concepts can illuminate important civic topics, making mathematics relevant and engaging for students while addressing real-world political challenges.</p>

                    <p>Engage in several hands-on experiments appropriate for a high school classroom. Gather, graph, and analyze data and then determine the appropriate regression model to fit the data. Discover ways to generate data that illustrates linear, exponential, quadratic, logarithmic, and logistic behavior.</p>
                    <p>Leave this session with practical, ready-to-implement activities that help students understand the connection between real-world phenomena and mathematical functions.</p>

                    <p>Sonia Kovalevsky overcame immensely difficult obstacles to pursue her mathematical education. What are the roadblocks today to women's success in mathematics and science? Is the STEM pipeline still leaking?</p>
                    <p>Learn about current data for women's participation in STEM and discuss solutions you can implement in your own classroom, building, and district. This session provides actionable strategies for creating more inclusive and supportive learning environments.</p>

                <p>During lunch, explore the SAMU building and discover mathematical concepts hidden throughout the architecture and surroundings. This activity offers a fun way to see mathematics in the physical world and could inspire similar activities at your own school.</p>

                <h3>Faculty Career Panel</h3>
                <p>Join CWU faculty members as they share their diverse paths to careers in mathematics. This panel discussion provides insights into the many opportunities available to students who pursue mathematics and can help you guide your own students toward STEM careers.</p>

                <h3>Focus Groups</h3>
                <p>Share your experiences and insights with other educators. These informal discussions allow you to connect with colleagues, exchange ideas, and provide feedback about the day's activities.</p>
